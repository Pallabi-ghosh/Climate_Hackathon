Automation tool & impact analysis for PlanBørnefonden challenge, part of the Climate Hachathon hosted by Stratiteq and Microsoft.

Inspiration
Understand the people's needs, resources and capacities as fast and thoroughly as possible. When a disaster occurs, humanitarian organizations have hard time collecting and analyzing data to understand the needs of the affected people in a fast way, so they can have a fast response and send help to the needed ones in the needed areas.

What it does
That’s why we are creating a tool that automates the collection and analyzation of data and also comparing it to the previously collected one so that this organizations can come to a more accurate solution, faster and with much less effort.

How we built it
We have designed a Front end using react.js and collected the responses at backend. We have also applied Machine learning models to interpret the meaning out the text that is generated using this tool. We used technologies like react.js, my sql, python, pandas, numpy.

Team: Monica, Pallabi, Tithi and Enqira.

Usage:
Make sure you install from main folder and back-end folder the dependencies for the server and client side.
npm run dev : starts back-end and front-end
npm start: start client side
cd back-end/ npm start : start backend.
